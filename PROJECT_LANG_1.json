{"About:"}
{"I decided to make JSON the main project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Scope) as this is a JSON data repository centered around a project hierarchy scope file written in JSON, and is the main language of this project. It needs to be represented with its own project language file, so it is getting its own project language file, starting here."}
